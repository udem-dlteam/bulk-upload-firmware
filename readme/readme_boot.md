# MicroPython Code Documentation - `boot.py`

This file is executed on every boot, including wake-boot from deep sleep. It performs certain actions during the boot process.

## Dependencies
The code has the following dependencies:
- `_blinx_test` module for the testing
- `_blinx_blinx` module 
  - `button`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` classes from the `_blinx_blinx` module
- `_blinx_program` module
- `os` module from MicroPython

## Code Explanation

The code in `boot.py` performs the following actions:

1. Commented out lines related to `esp` and `webrepl` modules are provided, which are typically used for debugging and remote access purposes.

2. The code checks if the test file (`_blinx_test.py` or `_blinx_test.mpy`) exists in the current directory. If the test file exists, it imports and executes the `_blinx_test` module.

3. If the test file does not exist, it imports the `button`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` variables from the `_blinx_blinx` module.

4. If neither the left button (`LEFT`) nor the right button (`RIGHT`) is pressed, it imports and executes the `_blinx_program` module.

## Usage Example

The `boot.py` file is automatically executed during the boot process and does not require manual invocation.
