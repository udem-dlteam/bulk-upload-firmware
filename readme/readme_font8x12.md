# MicroPython Code Documentation - `_blinx_font8x12.py`

This file contains a bitmap font definition for an 8x12 pixel font used in the Blinx platform.

The font is represented by a list named `bitmap`. Each element in the list represents a character bitmap, starting from ASCII character 0 (null) up to ASCII character 127 (DEL).

The font is monospaced with a width of 8 pixels and a height of 12 pixels. Each character is represented by a binary string of length 12, where each bit corresponds to a pixel. The binary string is converted to bytes using the `b'\x..'` format.

To access a specific character's bitmap, you can use the ASCII value of the character as the index in the `bitmap` list. For example, `bitmap[65]` retrieves the bitmap for the uppercase letter 'A'.
