# MicroPython Code Documentation - `_blinx_test.py`

This code appears to be a test script for various functionalities and components in a MicroPython environment. It performs several tests, including file system operations, screen initialization and display, LED testing, buzzer testing, and sensor testing. It also includes network-related tasks such as connecting to a WLAN, retrieving time from a Unix time server, and setting the time on the device.

The script starts by initializing the necessary libraries and checking for any errors that occur during initialization. It then proceeds to perform different tests:

1. File System Test: It lists the files in the file system and checks if certain required files are present.

2. Screen Test: It initializes an SSD1306 screen and performs some screen operations such as filling rectangles, displaying text, and showing the screen.

3. LED Test: It blinks an LED connected to pin 8.

4. Buzzer Test: It plays a tone using PWM on pin 8.

5. SHT3C Sensor Test: It reads the temperature and humidity values from the SHT3C sensor and displays them on the screen.

6. Network Test: It connects to a WLAN, retrieves the current time from a Unix time server, and sets the device's time accordingly.

## Dependencies
- `_blinx_blinx` module as `blinx`
- `_blinx_ssd1306` module as `ssd1306`
- `_blinx_config` module as `_config`
- `_blinx_wifi` module as `_wifi`
- `uasyncio` module from MicroPython
- `os` module from MicroPython
- `network` module from MicroPython
- `sys` module from MicroPython
- `time` module from MicroPython
- `machine` module from MicroPython

## Variables

### `error` (boolean)
Indicates whether an error has occurred during the execution of the code.

### `log_error(text)` (function)
Logs an error message to a file named `_blinx_error.txt`.

## Functions

### `test_connection()` (async function)
An asynchronous function that tests network connection by attempting to connect to a list of Unix time servers. It also calls other functions to set the time from the Unix time servers.

### `settime_from_unixtime_servers()` (async function)
An asynchronous function that attempts to connect to Unix time servers, retrieves the Unix time value, and sets the system time accordingly.

### `settime(t)` (function)
Sets the system time using the provided Unix time value.

### `wlan_start_connect()` (async function)
An asynchronous function that initiates a WLAN connection by connecting to the specified Wi-Fi network.

### `wlan_connect_loop(wl)` (async function)
An asynchronous function that loops until a WLAN connection is established. It sets the `wlan_connected` flag when the connection is successful.

### `AsyncReader` (class)
A class that provides asynchronous reading capabilities.

#### `__init__(self, rstream)` (function)
Class constructor that initializes the AsyncReader instance with the provided input stream.

#### `read_byte()` (async function)
Asynchronously reads a single byte from the input stream.

#### `expect(seq)` (async function)
Asynchronously checks if the next sequence of bytes in the input stream matches the provided sequence.

#### `read_group(ender)` (async function)
Asynchronously reads a group of bytes from the input stream until the specified ending byte is encountered.

#### `read_header_attribute(attribute)` (async function)
Asynchronously reads a header attribute from the input stream.

#### `read_to_eof()` (async function)
Asynchronously reads all remaining bytes from the input stream.

## Execution

The code contains the execution logic that creates tasks and runs the event loop for testing the network connection and running other tests.
